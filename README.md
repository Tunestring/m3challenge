# <Module 3 Challenge: Random Password Generator>

## Description

This project was done to demonstrate skills learned to design and build a random password generator that will create a password from 8 - 128 characters long. The password will prompt the user if they want to use uppcase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters in the generated password.

## Installation

None required.

## Usage

Click the button labeled "Generate Password" which will give the user a string of prompts determining the variables used in the password generator. Set the variables, and the generator will randomly generate a password with the user input criteria.
